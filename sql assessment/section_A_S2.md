**Answer:**

I would use a **LEFT JOIN** to display every registered customer along with their most recent order details, including customers who have never placed an order.

**Example SQL Query:**

```sql
SELECT 
    c.customer_id,
    c.customer_name,
    o.order_id,
    o.order_date,
    o.total_amount
FROM customers c
LEFT JOIN orders o
    ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id;
```

**Why LEFT JOIN instead of INNER JOIN?**

* **LEFT JOIN:** Returns all customers, including those who have never placed an order. Their order details will appear as `NULL`.
* **INNER JOIN:** Returns only customers who have matching records in both tables.

**What data would be lost with INNER JOIN?**

Customers who have never placed an order would be excluded from the report. This would prevent the marketing team from identifying inactive customers and targeting them with promotional offers.

**Conclusion:** LEFT JOIN is the best choice because it includes every registered customer, whether they have placed an order or not.
